    <h2>There are not many certainties in life – death and taxes are probably
        the main ones. Now there is another. At some time, we are all likely to
        need a Curriculum Vitae, or CV for short. Whether we’re leaving
        school or college, wanting a career change, experiencing redundancy
        or returning from a career break, our first priority is to get a CV
        written.
        Not only is a CV necessary for the benefit of the intended reader, but
        as this book will illustrate, compiling one can provide a great insight
        for you personally. Rather than relying on someonewho doesn’t know
        you to write your ‘personal sales brochure’, this book gives you a
        practical step-by-step approach to creating your own.
        We have all faced the frustration of knowing we can do the job, but
        how dowe get ‘a foot in the door’? Your CV is the key to opening those
        doors. You will learn not just how to sell yourself, but how to tailor
        and vary your approach accordingly. Interviews will also take on a
        new meaning when we see the role our CV typically plays in that
        situation. Packed with exercises and case studies, this book provides
        insights and tips gained from helping thousands of people of all ages
        and from all backgrounds to successfully market themselves.
        In writing this book I would particularly like to thank my mum and
        brother Andy for all their support and encouragement over the years. I
        would also especially like to acknowledge, once again, my wife Helen.
        By her actions she continues to provide even more definitions to the
        meaning of the words partner and friend. Thank you</h2>
